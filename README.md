# Advent of code 2019

documented here are my solutions to advent of code 2019
I had some fun doing this interactively in [twilioquest](https://twilio.com/quest), an interactive rpg that teaches you how to code.
this repo can be run without the game, however, as a node project.

# How to run

The questions for each challenge are written as comments.
i have set up an node project with dotenv to import the input files and parse them.

- step 1: clone this repo
- step 2: use node to run the file you'd like, for example  
  `node day1.js`  
   input files are saved as txt, and parsed to arrays using core node modules fs and path, and javascript's Array.split() method
